# Mini CRUD MERN Project-A fullstack web application

![REST API](https://i.ibb.co/7GWCCbp/Screenshot-2020-07-12-at-08-30-32.png)

In this Project I built a fullstack web application using MERN stack (MongoDB, Express js, React js, Node js). We will cover all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Hope you'll like it!

packages that I had used:
- In the client dir:
    - react-bootstrap bootstrap.
    - react-router-dom.
    - axios 

- In the root dir:
    -  cors.
    - express.
    - mongoose.
    - nodemon.
